### Final Proposal
1. Persona - model each section more after canvas description
2. Scenario
    Our typical end-user is a redistricting researcher who wants to learn more about how redistricting criteria are in tension with each other, and so they go to our website. To get a sense of how different district arrangements yield differential outcomes, they pull up two of the maps side by side. To compare efficiency gap, modularity, and compactness outcomes, they choose those attributes to be displayed with the choropleth maps by clicking on a attribute name or district line in the parallel coordinate plot. To filter districts to only those with attributes in certain ranges, they use the thumb slides on the parallel coordinate plot. To rank district populations, areas, or percent of a given demographic (ie black, white), they re-express the map as a bar chart. To closely inspect district they know well or their home location, they add an overlay with the OSM street map to give spatial context, and then they click on a district to bring up a zoomed-in map popup which has cbg-level geometry overlayed on the map, along with the cbg GEOIDs.
