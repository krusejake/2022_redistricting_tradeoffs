### Final Proposal
1. Persona and scenario
- **Persona**: Our end-user is a political science researcher who wants to learn more about how redistricting criteria are in tension with each other, in order to support their goals of providing better redistricting criteria for the State of Wisconsin. Their main goal is to find relevant literature that could support their own research, and so concise summaries and well-presented dashboards help to greatly reduce their workload. For a given redistricting approach, the researcher needs to be able to compare maps produced with different criteria in order to find patterns in district formation, and trends in the underlying demographic data, that stem from optimizing for different criteria. Finding gerrymandered districts (anomalies) and comparing them with other potential arrangingments gives the researcher useful context.
- **Scenario**:
     To get a sense of how different district arrangements yield differential outcomes, they pull up two of the maps side by side. To compare efficiency gap, modularity, and compactness outcomes, they choose those attributes to be displayed with the choropleth maps by clicking on a attribute name or district line in the parallel coordinate plot (PCP). To filter districts to only those with attributes in certain ranges, they use the thumb slides on map and PCP legend. To rank district populations, areas, or percent of a given demographic group, they re-express the map as a bar chart. To identify a district they know well or their home location, they add an overlay with the OSM street map to give spatial context, and then they click on a district to bring up a zoomed-in map popup which has cbg-level geometry overlayed on the map, along with the cbg GEOIDs. They leave the mouse hovering over the district to retrieve relevant district census data. When comparing the map optimized for fairness to the current district map, they notice that several cbgs next to Milwaukee have changed district. They reexpress the maps as bar charts and select demographic data to be displayed, leading to the insight that the fairer map is more racially balanced than the current map.
