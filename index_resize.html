                        can be in tension with each other. Here, we focus on two common redistricting criteria, compactness

                    <h2>Gerrymandering</h2>
                    <p class='paragaphText' style='text-align: justify;'>
                        In the United States, political districts are redrawn every 10 years to reflect new
                        Census data. When redrawing electoral district boundaries, legislators may try to
                        create districts so as to create an advantage for their party: this is gerrymandering.
                        Political gerrymandering is currently legal as long as it is not excessive, though what
                        constitutes "excess" is difficult to define. While gerrymandering for the purpose of
                        gaining partisan advantage is legal to some extent, gerrymandering to disenfranchise
                        voters on a racial basis is illegal. In either case, gerrymandering seeks to give one party
                        more representatives for the same number of votes, thus diluting the voting power of other parties.                      
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Though political gerrymandering is legal and to some degree unavoidable, many scholars
                        agree that it is harmful for our democracy: if voters feel like their vote doesn't count, they
                        lose faith in our government.

                        A communitiy is a group of people that have more in common with each other, on average, than they do with
                        people from another group. Redistricting groups people across geographic space, and therefore can either split
                        communities or keep them intact.
                 
                        Redistricting laws in many states have explicit preferences for redistricting plans that follow existing boundaries,
                        such as county lines, which implicitly encourages communities to be kept intact. Frequently, in legal challenges
                        to gerrymandered districts, split municipalities are shown as evidence that natural communities were split 
                        in order to gain partisan advantage.
                        <br><br>
                        Communities of interest and majority-minority districts are two explicit ways of keeping particular communities intact,
                        and both function by keeping groups of people with common policy concerns in a single district. For communities of interest,
                        people from such a group self identify and advocate for being kept in a single interest so that they can elect a representative
                        that will represent their particular interests. Majority-minority districts are similar, though they are required by the
                        Voting Rights Act so as to not "improperly dilute minorities voting power."
                        <br><br>
                        None of these community formations, however, attempt to maintain communities across <i>all</i> districts. 
                        Framed as an optimization problem, we might ask how we could make districts such that we maintain as many communities
                        as possible within each district, such that we minimize community splitting across all districts. While optimization
                        is redistricting is notoriously difficult, we attempt here to show at least what a range of possibilities might look like
                        if such a metric were incorporated into redistricting law.
                        <br><br>
                        For such an optimization, we need both a formula for defining community strength, and a measurement to use in that formula.
                        For the measurement, we employ human mobility flows from Safegraph. The mobility flows consist of anomymized cellphone counts 
                        that have moved from one census block group to another during a given time span. To quantify community strength, we use 
                        modularity, which is freqeuntly used in community detection research. Modularity here is defined as the sum of district intra flow
                        divided by the sum of district inter flows, where intra flows are mobility flows originating in one district and ending in that same
                        district, while inter flows are mobility flows originating in one district and ending in another. By summing across all districts
                        to calculate modularity, we can get a sense of how the districting plan, as a whole, keeps communties intact.

                                "[The efficiency gap] represents the difference between the parties’ respective wasted votes in an 
                                election—where a vote is wasted if it is cast (1) for a losing cadidate, or 
                                (2) for a winning candidate but in excess of what she 
                                needed to prevail. Large numbers of votes commonly are cast for 
                                losing candidates as a result of the time-honored gerrymandering technique of “cracking.”
                                Likewise, excessive votes often are cast for winning candidates thanks to the equally 
                                age-old mechanism of “packing.” The efficiency gap essentially aggregates all of a district 
                                plan’s cracking and packing choices into a single, tidy number."

                                districts, and votes for a given party a represented by icons of the same color. The Green party
                                receives 20/50 votes, yet is able to win 3/5 seats due to how the districts were arranged.

                        Compactness is metric that is used in redistricting to help guard against gerrymandering. Compactness
                        can be defined geometrically in many ways, but the general idea in redistricting is to avoid long, odd shapes
                        that demonstrate intent to unnaturally split communities in such as way as to crack and pack districts. For
                        more specifics on compactness, you can refer to

                        Here, we use the Polsby-Popper definition of compactness, which essentially compares
                        the area and perimeter of a district. The range of values of this metric is from 0 to 1, where 0 is 
                        the least compact and 1 is the most compact (the district is circular).
